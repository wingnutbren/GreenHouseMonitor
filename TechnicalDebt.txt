Module, testWebInterface, needs better test_website_responds() method
    The 'test_website_responds()' method is silly because to init the class, a call is already made to a known form that has a csrf token.  If an invalid url is given, the init method throws since the 404 will not have a csrf token included in the response

Testing Wrong
    the test cases are under 'test' subdir, but the classes to test are above. Running from the Test directory and importing .. works, but I can't get the debugger to work in that state.

No PUT
    webinterface should use put instead of post

No JSON payload 
    webinterface should use json=payload instead of payload

Confusing modulename
module name and class name 'thermometer is confusing. Consider refactoring class name with captials

Bad CSRF token handling
the home.html page has the csrf token in a form element. find another way to put this in the response
