Module, testWebInterface, needs better test_website_responds() method
    The 'test_website_responds()' method is silly because to init the class, a call is already made to a known form that has a csrf token.  If an invalid url is given, the init method throws since the 404 will not have a csrf token included in the response

Testing Wrong
    the test cases are under 'test' subdir, but the classes to test are above. Running from the Test directory and importing .. works, but I can't get the debugger to work in that state.
